# UoN CubeSat Web Interface

This directory contains the code for a React app that integrates with the Yamcs server. For the app to get information, the Yamcs application must first be started. The tracker on the home page currently follows the live path of the ISS, however, this will be updated to be the path of the CubeSat once launched. 

**Development of this web interface has been paused, as it is largely redundant when compared to the provided Yamcs Web Interface**
